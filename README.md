# Context-Aware Augmentations for Data-Efficient Object Detection

This is the PyTorch implementation of Context-Aware Augmentations for Data-Efficient Object Detection (Currently under review).

## Dataset
[PASCAL VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/), [BDD](https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/) and [Synthetic Fruits](https://github.com/roboflow/synthetic-fruit-dataset)  datasets were utilized for all our experiments. 

## Requirements
We tested our code with the following package versions

```bash
pytorch 1.10.2
cudatoolkit 10.2.89

```
